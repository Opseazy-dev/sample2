                <h3>The Madras High Court  is one of the oldest High Courts of India.
                    It is located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The court is one of the three
                    High Courts in India established in the three Presidency Towns of 
                    Madras, Bombay and Calcutta by letters patent granted by Queen Victoria,
                    bearing date 26 June 1862. It exercises original jurisdiction over the city
                    of Chennai and appellate jurisdiction over the entire state of Tamil Nadu 
                    and Union territory of Puducherry, as well as extraordinary original
                    jurisdiction, civil and criminal, under the letters patent and special
                    original jurisdiction for the issue of writs under the Constitution of
                    India. Covering 107 acres, the court complex is one of the largest in the
                    world, next only to Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, London.
